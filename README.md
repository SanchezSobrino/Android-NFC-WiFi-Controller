Android NFC-WiFi Controller
====================================

Introduction
------------
This program allows the user to change between slides using an Android device.
It uses a mobile device capable to use **NFC technology**, but it's not mandatory.

The client connects the server using its wifi connection and the **QR Code** generated by the
server. Then, the client just has to use the Android device to scan the NFC tags in order
to change the current slide or using the virtual keys.
